The input should be read from standard in, with one number per line.  For each line of input, the program should print to standard out the estimated running mean, running standard deviation, and running median.

Choose a sensible tradeoff.  Better yet, allow this to be configurable.\n","\n"," \n","\n","Ideally, this program should be able to handle arbitrarily long lists of inputs.  It would be nice for it to output results as soon as possible, instead of needing to wait for all of standard in to be read.  You do not have to worry about malicious input (there wonâ€™t be 10 GB on a single line), but gracefully handling malformed input lines is a plus.\n","\n"," \n","\n","Upload your solution to the public DVCS host of your choice, and send us a link to the repository.
